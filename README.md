# Grid Component

We have created a grid component which makes the Grid creation and it's integration with XBlock simpler.
It can be used in applications where Grid is required e.g. Board games like Chess , Sudoku.

We have created a ChessgridXBlock in which we have used the grid_library.js.

To use our grid_library.js, one need to include our library in their XBlock.
After one can access it's function

# Functionality
